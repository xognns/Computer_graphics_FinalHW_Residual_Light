# Residual Light

Three.js 기반 컴퓨터그래픽스 최종 과제 게임입니다. DDGI 기반 indirect lighting을 게임플레이에 연결해 Lumen AI와 사물 가시성에 반영하는 것을 핵심 목표로 잡고 개발했습니다.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Visual Verification with VS Code Live Server

Live Server should serve the production build in `dist/`, not the source root.

```bash
npm run build
```

Then use VS Code Live Server's **Go Live** command. This workspace includes `.vscode/settings.json`, so Live Server opens `dist/` on port `5500`.

Expected URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```

## Deploy

The project is a static Vite app. It can be deployed to Vercel or GitHub Pages after pushing the repository.

- Vercel: import the Git repository and use the default Vite settings.
- GitHub Pages: build with `npm run build` and publish the `dist/` directory.

## Current Controls

- `WASD`: Move
- `E`: Repair generator / use extraction console
- `Q`: Throw neon ball
- `Mouse`: Aim flashlight direction
- `Left click`: Toggle flashlight
- `P`: Toggle DDGI probe markers
- `R`: Toggle direct/indirect ray debug while playing
- `B`: Toggle bright map debug
- `R`: Restart after victory or failure

## Goal

Repair 6 generators, avoid Lumen by manipulating direct and indirect light, and report power restoration at the final console.

## Report

The final report draft is `report.md`. Any image marked with `TODO: 캡처 필요` must be replaced with an actual screenshot from this game before submission.
